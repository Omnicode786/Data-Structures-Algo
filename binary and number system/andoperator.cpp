//  the and operator is simply like the and gate



// The rightmost bit (last bit) in binary decides if a number is even or odd.
// If the last bit is 1, the number is odd.
// If the last bit is 0, the number is even.

// 1010 = 10 = __even
// 1011 = 11 = odd



//  it basically converts everything to binary and then check

// 10&1 = 1010 & 0001 now it checks just the last bit so 0&1 = 0 hence it's even
